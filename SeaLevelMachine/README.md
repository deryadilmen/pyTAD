# The Sea Level Machine ( SLM )

The Seal Level Machine is a web site that visualizes all the Tsunami events occurred since year 2000.  The data are obtained from the NOAA NGDC database (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/tsu_db.shtml). For each event the correspondibng report in the Global Disaster Alerts and Coordination System (GDACS, http://www.gdacs.org) is identified and connected.  This allows to extract the GTS message that were produced by the Tsunami Service Providers for that particular event, that are stored in the GDACS database.  

GDACS developed routines to extract from each GTS message the reported Tsunami height, period and arrival time.  This allows therefore to visualize for each event which tide gauge was used by the Tsunami Service Providers during their analysis and if possible,  download and process these data.

Unfortunately not for all the events we have the GTS messages. GDACS started to collect them routiney since 2014 and with the help of some colleagues from NOA, Athens, we could include some data from 2012 to 2014. Also, in some cases the GTS mesages are not visible either because they are not open but protected by a passowrd (i.e. Australian Metereological Bureau) or because the processing of the GTS does not allow a secure understanding.
